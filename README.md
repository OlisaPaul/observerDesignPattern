This project is used to illustrate how the observer deign pattern works.
It also uses the module design pattern, because both the Observer and the Subject classes are in different files respectively. These classes are exported (using module.exports) so that other files can have access to it.
We import the classes in the index.js where the ultimate impletation is carried out.

To run this program, use: node index.js
